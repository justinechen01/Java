Grinnell was founded as a "Yankee" town, by settlers from New England descended from the English Puritans in the 1600s.[5][6] Grinnell was founded in 1854 by four men: Josiah B. Grinnell, a Congregationalist from Vermont; Homer Hamlin, a minister; Henry Hamilton, a surveyor; and Dr. Thomas Holyoke.[7] The city was to be named "Stella," but J.B. Grinnell convinced the others to adopt his name, describing it as rare and concise.[8] Grinnell was incorporated on April 28, 1865,[9] and by 1880 Grinnell had a population of around 2000. Located at the junction of two railway lines (east-west line of the Rock Island Railroad and the north-south Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway), it is the largest community in Poweshiek County.
